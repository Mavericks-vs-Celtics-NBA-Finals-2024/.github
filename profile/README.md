How to watch Dallas Mavericks vs. Boston Celtics Game 1 without cable

If your cable subscription doesn't carry ABC or you've cut the cord with your cable company, you can still watch today's game. Below are the platforms on which you can watch today's game Li𝚟e.

If you don't have cable TV that includes ABC, one of the most cost-effective ways to stream today's game is through a subscription to Sling TV. To watch today's game, you'll need a subscription to the Blue tier, which includes access to your local network affiliate's Li𝚟e feed (excluding CBS). To level up your coverage and get access to NBA playoff games broadcast on ESPN and TNT, subscribe to the Orange + Blue tier plan. Also worth noting: Sling TV comes with 50 hours of cloud-based DVR recording space included, perfect for recording today's championship game.

The Blue tier is $45 per month. The Sling's Orange + Blue tier costs $60 per month, but the platform is currently offering 50% off the first month of any pricing tier, making the Orange + Blue tier $30 for the first month.

Note: Because Sling TV doesn't carry CBS, you won't be able to watch CBS-aired programming like next year's NFL games on CBS. To watch these games, plus PGA golf, UEFA Champions League and more Li𝚟e sports, we recommend you also subscribe to Paramount+ with Showtime. Paramount+ with Showtime costs $12 per month after a one-week free trial.

Top features of Sling TV Orange + Blue tier:

Sling TV is also our top choice to stream the NHL Playoffs.

There are 46 channels to watch in total, including ABC, NBC and Fox (where available).

You get access to NBA games airing on TNT.

All subscription tiers include 50 hours of cloud-based DVR storage.
